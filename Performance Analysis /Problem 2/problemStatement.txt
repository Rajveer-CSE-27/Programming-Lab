Insertion/Deletion from start and end, with probability of insertions ranging from 0,10,20,...,100%,  and probability of start ranging from 0,10,20...,100%
                [Dynamic Array, leaving double space at start and end]

 Additionally, store the time and space used in data files using /usr/bin/time command.
     Use bash scripting to process these data files to report in a summary of the same.Z
     Tools/concepts used: Makefile along with Compile time and Runtime Parameters,
                                          Random input generation which is reproducible using random seed.
                                         Take average over several test cases to report performance.
                                          Output and store time and space using /usr/bin/time by using error stream
                                          Use bash scripting to collect and summarize data from files.
     The output of Bash file should be
